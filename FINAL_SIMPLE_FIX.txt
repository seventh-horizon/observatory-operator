FIXED THE LAST BUG!

The file controllers/logic_test.go line 5 had:
  github.com/seventh-horizon/observatory-operator/api/v1alpha1

Changed to:
  github.com/example/observatory-operator/api/v1alpha1

Also fixed: WorkflowSpec -> Workflow (struct name change)

NOW RUN THIS:

  cd /Users/kalebkirby/release-hardened
  chmod +x fix.sh
  ./fix.sh

This will:
1. Clean Go cache
2. Run go mod tidy
3. Check go.sum was created
4. Build the project

If successful, then run:
  ./hack/run-tests.sh

THATS IT!
